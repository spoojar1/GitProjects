Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word.

Return all such possible sentences.

For example, given
s = "snakesandladder",
dict = ["snake", "snakes", "and", "sand", "ladder"].

A solution is ["snakes and ladder",
           "snake sand ladder"].

Input:
First line is integer T denoting number of test cases. 1<=T<=100.
Every test case has 3 lines.
First line is N number of words in dictionary. 1<=N<=20.
Second line contains N strings denoting the words of dictionary. Length of each word is less than 15.
Third line contains a string S of length less than 1000.

Output:
Print all possible strings in one line. Each string enclosed in ().See Example.
If no string possible print "Empty" (without qoutes).

Note:Make sure the strings are sorted in your result.

Exapmle:
Input:
1
5
lr m lrm hcdar wk
