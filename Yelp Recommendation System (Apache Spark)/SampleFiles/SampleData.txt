6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA,6ilJq_05xRgek_8qUp36-g,I like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great But this location is always woefully understaffed with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated Whether youre inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long Fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here,2.0,4.0
6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,They have good acts coming around here and often give out free tickets particularly ine summer Ive never actually paid full price for a ticket here The twoitem minimum is bit bothersome to me thoughI dont mind the requirement so much but the quality isnt good and the prices are high Our four items total came to about  two appetizers and two beers and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers arent even very friendly Also bewarethey have a lot of rules here They wont seat till the whole party is there if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner automatic gratuity added to the check etc etcThe box office is also weirdyou get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slideunder slotthen you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there so I dont get the whole hoopla with the windowAll in all though the seats are comfy enough the atmosphere is pretty nice and the acts are good,3.0,5.0
6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA,tv8cS4aaA1VDaInYgggb6g,Its sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy acts other than the big uns in the Cultural District I hate this places MO The space itself is fineonly a few blind spots nice intimate venue They bring decent acts in although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts But the two item minimum just infuriates me Overpriced shitty food and drinks We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night hilarious show very nice guy signed our CD and posed for photos with people We dropped  on a chicken quesadilla  hot wings and  Yuengling drafts The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for  Burgatory is right down the street Hell TGI Fridays would have been better Ive been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality  The Improvs saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets,2.0,3.0
jsfzrOPsQ5U8auXYRd4eRA,YX_cdwb0A62hdQRBiZJgtQ,Unprofessional  We ended up here due to being recommended by the insurance company It WAS my fault for leaving an iPod in the vehicle but regardless it was stolen The owner would not take responsibility for the theft and firmly stood by his employees He did say that the cars are occasionally left unlocked outside the building BAD PRACTICE  Nonetheless I am out an iPod and he is out everyones business that asks me for a recommendation for auto repair LOCK THE CARS,1.0,2.0

xqk-h7HAGyUlVbvEUUf67Q,EoAY1JSVeJriBzId8lUQwQ,Dont even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard cinnamon butter and a spicy queso dip The queso is my favorite but they were all delish I also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious  MF is  off appetizers so I was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for  bucks as a meal The menu had a pretty wide range my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad We didnt get drinks but some looked good,4.0,4.0
