P1fJb2WQ1mXoiudj8UE44w,2012-01-02,G-gqp94DI9ZX3Qp4HdMCmA,2,I have to say that I write this review with much regret because I have always loved PaPa Js But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit From the minute we were seated we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didnt know the menu As I said before Ive been to PaPa Js a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well but the server couldnt explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes agoBut it wasnt just the knowledge of the menu It was one thing after another with our server My wife asked for a glass of water  times until she finally got it at which point the meal was over so we didnt care at that point  I mean come on for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water There was no one filling up waterMy biggest complaint however is what happened with our meals My dad and I both ordered the trout special trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat Instead the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms Not what the special was at all  And by the way that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server which we are sure it was or the chef who knows for certain Not to mention though that a good server wouldnt have served us that regardless But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server let me continue When we informed our server of the mistake he didnt really believe us until he checked his order sheet and then he blamed the error on the chef At this point the meal had been sitting because it took us forever to flag this guy down again so the trout was basically cold The server then said he would have the meals remade So he took the meals back to the kitchen Meanwhile of course my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda yes believe that or not All the kitchen did was scrape their mistake off of our fish They didnt remake anything Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it Quite frankly the fish wasnt good at all I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonalds that night The server never did anything to try to make our experience better  he knew we werent happy but never offered anything such as dessert on the house Im not looking for a handout but our experience was just plain awful that night The guy never really even apologized for the mistake Normally I may have asked for a manager but at this point I was ready to just get out of there plus we had to be somewhere else that nightMy opinion for the money there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at,review,k-a1aAKB0f6w5sHDDEO4IA,1,0,4

FiXamVMgMf9U0VqFHDZSEA,2015-01-31,EYzgB4Ok77qw5QMmIaPnlw,3,Sometimes I use Panera as a lunch place and sometimes I use it as an office Either way I tend to spend a lot of time at Panera If I am meeting someone I prefer to sit in a booth for more privacy I like the homey feel of Panera and love it when I get to sit by the fireplace The bakery items are always fresh Its nice that they keep the chocolate chip cookies warm YumThe food is unpredictable Sometimes its good and sometimes its not so good The serving sizes on their soups and salads have shrunk considerably in the last year They do have a good selection of food They keep adding healthier options Their recent addition is Soba Noodle Bowls They look good but I sense a lot of sodium hides in them If you need a place to meet someone to chat or get some work done it is a good place Food wise there are many other choices to consider around the city for better food at the same prices,review,KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw,0,0,0

FiXamVMgMf9U0VqFHDZSEA,2015-08-06,sC6zvWd6AGOpU3y3883KmA,3,This Panera Bread location is ideally located in the Waterfront shopping center in the midst of several shops and a large parking lot The space itself is much larger than many other locations I have been to and has ample seating which is always a good thing Unfortunately the service is slow and unfriendly there was no line and it took a few moments for someone to notice there were customers trying to order I was surprised that I was automatically given a baguette with my meal rather than being offered a choice between the bread an apple or a bag of chips Perhaps it is this location or maybe it was just a oneoff oversight As I mentioned there is plenty of seating but our options were limited because all of the tables were disgusting with trash on them and in desperate need of a wipedown If it were over lunch or a rush I would be more sympathetic but there were only a handful of patrons in the entire establishment I was also upset that the WiFi was not functioning Despite my nitpicking the food was fine and it is a standard Panera just not a stellar location,review,s0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q,1,0,0
FiXamVMgMf9U0VqFHDZSEA,2015-11-29,56v84iiPmP3nYHZPpCWQ9Q,3,It has been several months since I visited Panera Bread It is a bakery cafe chain with free WiFi Prices are reality the same although from time to time they change their seasonal offeringsFood is fair You order and you are given a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready They use real dishes and silverware The menu gives you a calorie count of each item you are purchasing  One of the popular feature items is you pick two where you can have half a sandwich or salad or soup in a pair of two of those items You also get with it a choice of an apple or roll and you can add a dessert for I was disappointed to learn they had removed the French onion soup from the menu I asked about this removal only to learn there was something wrong with one of the ingredients The other disappointment was that this year they are not making gingerbread men which are one of my favorite holiday treats Instead they are offering a holiday themed sugar cookieI normally eat here when Im in a hurry and dont have time to sit down at a regular restaurant They do use fresh breads and they do cater You can also order your holiday baked goods or breads for your parties,review,9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ,1,0,1
